There should be 3 scripts in this folder:

- generateJSON.py
- generatePDF.py
- generateAll.py

As the extension suggests, these are Python scripts. In order to use them you need to install the Python interpreter.
The last version (3.x) should be fine. You can download it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
After having installed Python you have to decompress the archive (all of it, not just the script files).
Then, in order to run a script you need to either double-click it (if you don't want to pass a parameter) or:

- Shift + right click in this folder and select "Open command window here"
- type "python nameofscript.py parameter" and press Enter


### generateJSON.py ###

Merges all the text files contained in the "txt" folder in the JSON file "S;G_OST.json".
The JSON is created in the same directory of the script. If you want to output it elsewhere you need to pass the path as a parameter.
Make sure that the "txt" folder is in the same directory of the script, otherwise it won't work.


### generatePDF.py ###

Creates the PDF file "S;G_OST.pdf" from the JSON file, so make sure the latter is present in the directory.
The PDF is created in the same directory of the script. If you want to output it elsewhere you need to pass the path as a parameter.
If you choose to overwrite the existing PDF, but the script terminates with an error, you may have to close the PDF viewer.
Make sure that the "fpdf" folder is in the same directory of the script, otherwise it won't work.


### generateAll.py ###

Executes "generateJSON.py" and "generatePDF.py", passing the parameter ".." to both.
Two dots mean "parent directory" in pathing convention, so you will find the two generated files in the upper folder.
